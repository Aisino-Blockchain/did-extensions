    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document serves as a collection of known DID Methods.

    <h1>DID Methods</h1>

    <p>
This table summarizes the DID method specifications currently in development.
The links will be updated as subsequent Implementerâ€™s Drafts are produced.
This registry does not act as an endorsement of any particular DID method or its
underlying technologies by the W3C, the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group,
or any affiliated members of the W3C. It exists as a mechanism for developers to
discover various DID methods that they might wish to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
The normative requirements for DID method specifications can be found in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">Decentralized Identifiers
v1.0: Methods</a> [[DID-CORE]]. DID methods that do not meet these requirements
will not be accepted. We encourage DID method authors to provide an email
address in the Author Links column, as this helps with maintenance.
If an email address is omitted, a label noting that there is no
contact information for the author will be applied to the registry entry.
